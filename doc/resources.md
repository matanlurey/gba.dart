## General

- [How To Write a Computer Emulator](http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/HOWTO.html)

  Explains a bit about what _is_ an emulator, legality, and techniques. Quite
  dated (talks about _C_ as modern), but otherwise has a lightweight description
  of the basics.

- [Emu-Docs](https://github.com/matanlurey/Emu-Docs/tree/master/GameBoy%20Advance)

  A fork of a previously popular repository of emulator documenation, which
  included a datasheet on the `ARM7TDMI`, and `test_roms` for verifying against.

## ARM7TDMI

- [ARM7 TDMI Datasheet](pdf/arm7-tdmi-datasheet.pdf)

- [ARM7 TDMI Instruction Timings](pdf/arm7-tdmi-instruction-timings.pdf)

## GameBoy Advance

- [GBATEK](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm)

  A main source of documentation on the technical specifications of the GBA,
  including a reference on the hardware, programming, CPU, and other technical
  data.

- [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/)

  A set of homebrew-oriented programming tutorials for GBA, including a bunch
  of example ROMs that are likely to be useful to test against.

- [Belogic](http://belogic.com/gba/)

  A great resource for understanding the sound and test ROMs for sounds.

- [GBADev](https://www.gbadev.org/)

  Another resource orirented at homebrew programming on the GBA.

- [No\$gba](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm)

  An emulator including a debug version that is widely considered the "best"
  way to debug/step through ROMs, which is likely to be useful until you build
  a comparable debugger.

- [Emulating the GBA](https://web.archive.org/web/20150428041044/http://6bit.net/shonumi/2015/04/19/emulating-the-gba/)

  A blog that explained a programmer's process in writing a GBA emulator.

- [Game Boy Advance Programming Manual](https://www.scribd.com/document/198178973/GameBoy-Advance-Programming-Manual)

  The original programming manual for the Game Boy Advance.

- [Awesome Game Boy Advance Development](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbadev)

  A list of additional resources (some are included above).

- ["CowBite" Virtual Hardware Specifications](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm)

  An informal specification of the GBA.

- [DevKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/)

  A compiler for GBA/ARM7TDMI.

- [pineight.com/gba](http://pineight.com/gba/)

  Another homebrew/test ROM resource for GBA.

- [mGBA](https://mgba.io/)

  One of the most maintained open-source emulators for GBA. There is even a
  public [test suite](https://github.com/mgba-emu/suite).

- [gba-suite](https://github.com/matanlurey/gba-suite)

  Another test suite of ROMs.
